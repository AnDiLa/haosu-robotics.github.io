          <p style="color: black">
            Mechanisms and design are critical to many advances in various fields of robotics. Still, many aspects of the design process are often left out of the reports on the work (like publications and presentations), which focus almost exclusively on the final iteration and its performance. This workshop aims to provide its audience an instructive view into the complete design process of some of the most successful of today's robots, from idea to realization. Invited speaker and contributors will present their work, starting from the original idea that sparked the process, through multiple design iterations (including failed prototypes and lessons learned), and finally arriving at the "demo unit". The workshop will illustrate this process in multiple domains. Instead of focusing on a particular research advancement, presentations and contributions will center on the process of design as fundamental to many areas, and illustrate it through multiple novel mechanisms and robots at the leading edge of the state of the art.</strong>

          <p class="speaker-title">What made me develop soft robot 34 years ago?</p>
          <p class="speaker-description">   
            I developed my first soft robot, named Flexible Microactuator, FMA in 1986. I will talk about why and how I developed it. I believe that we generally come up with various vague ideas of new mechanisms to meet the requirements, but I’m afraid we often exclude them unconsciously without being explicitly aware of them. I believe a key to creating new mechanisms and designs is to take a vague idea out of our mind and give it concrete form. From my experience in FMA development, I believe that two points are important: 1) don’t be afraid to differ from trends, and 2) be confident in the correctness of your idea. Even if your idea is correct, you cannot overcome the difficulties in the realization process without confidence in it. In my case, FEM helped me; seeing the results of the FEM helped me to be confident in the correctness of my idea and to overcome my hesitation and move on to prototyping.

            <strong>Bio:</strong>
            Prof. dr. ir. Bram Vanderborght was born in Belgium in 1980. I received the degree in the study of Mechanical Engineering at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in 2003 with highest distinction. Since 2003 I was researcher at the VUB, supported by the Fund for Scientific Research Flanders (FWO).

            In May 2007 I received my PhD in Applied Sciences. The focus of my research was the use of adaptable compliance of pneumatic artificial muscles in the dynamically balanced biped Lucy. In May-June 2006 I performed research on the humanoids robot HRP-2 at the Joint Japanese/French Robotics Laboratory (JRL) in AIST, Tsukuba (Japan) in the research "Dynamically stepping over large obstacles by the humanoid robot HRP-2". I received a 3-year post-doc grant with mobility grant from the FWO. From October 2007-April 2010 I worked as post-doc researcher at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genova (Italy) on the humanoid robot iCub and compliant actuation.
            
            Since October 2009, I am appointed as professor at the VUB where I teach mechatronics and give a robotics project. From October 2011-Sept 2016, I was research director at the Universitatea Babes-Bolyai, Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy with a project on robot assisted therapy with ASD children and VUB-PI of the DREAM project.

          <p class="speaker-description">   
            Our work on the design of parallel robots has begun since its start under the assumption that uncertainties, although always bounded, are unavoidable for a mechanical design. On the other hand in all of our designs we have set a list of performance requirements for the real robots, some being stringent (for example for safety purposes), some other being flexible to a certain amount (e.g the desired workspace). We have developed a methodology called ''appropriate design'', based on interval analysis, that allows one to determine nominal values of the design parameters in such way that in spite of the uncertainties the physical instance of our design is guaranteed to satisfy our requirements. An interest of this approach is that the method does not provide a single design solution but a whole set, thereby allows to consider various compromises in term of performances. But this method has also the advantage to allow to predict what will be the behavior of the real robot under computer control, hence providing clues on what perception information will be necessary to obtain a correct behavior of the robot. This approach will be illustrated on our numerous prototypes.

          <p class="speaker-description">   
            Robots made out of soft materials typically require tethered connections to external hardware for off-board power and computing.  This is because the muscle-like actuators used in most soft robotic applications utilize unconventional power sources (e.g. pneumatics, fluidics, high voltage) that are incompatible with miniaturized electronics, microcontrollers, and batteries.  Over the past ten years, I’ve been interested in creating soft robots that are fully untethered and can move at speeds similar to that of natural organisms.  While commonly demonstrated in piecewise rigid robots, achieving this functionality in soft robots has proven to be challenging.  In this talk, I will review recent efforts by my group to cut the cord and achieve untethered functionality for soft robots capable of inchworm-like crawling, walking, and swimming.  In particular, I will focus on the evolution of these robot systems and how we converged on certain architectures for soft actuation and robot design. In addition to discussing systems-level implementations of untethered soft robots, I will also briefly touch on device-level subcomponents that will enable untethered functionality in future soft robotic systems.  This includes elastically deformable batteries, energy harvesting transducers, and sensors that wirelessly transmit recordings of mechanical deformation.

            The creation of wearable robotic systems requires careful and thoughtful design choices to ensure the system balances high performance and low mass. In this talk, I will describe our process for designing wearable robots, with emphasis on priorities, tradeoffs, and lessons learned.  I will describe a four step process for analyzing system performance prior to design, and then discuss design strategies implemented in our Open Source Leg. The Open Source Leg is an open and freely available hardware platform designed to foster research on prosthetic control systems. The system has been designed for ease of assembly, manufacturing, and control, and has been adopted by eight institutions around the world.

          <p class="speaker-description">   
            My group started looking at 2D fabrication 30 years ago as a way to realize silicon micro-robots.  3D structures and mechanisms were created by folding plates with hinges out-of-plane. Our single-material polysilicon structures had flexures for movement but lacked any reasonable approximation to rotary joints.  A decade later, to fabricate a 100 milligram flapping flyer, the 2D fabrication was used with a thin metal foil.  Now the metal foil acted as a flexure, and folded triangular beams provided stiff links.  While kinematic structures with 17 joints showed controllable thrust generation at 110 Hz, the assembly was painful, and flexure lifetime was short. These lessons led us away from monolithic materials in 2003 to stacked heterogenous materials, with distinct layers for structure and joints. In addition to greatly reduced fabrication time, and greatly increased lifetime, the smart composite microstructures (SCM) process has led to surprisingly high performance millirobots, such as the cardboard 10.4 cm X2-VelociRoACH which can run at 4.9 m/s. Serendipitously, the folded designs are highly tolerant to impacts, and the low-mass shell structure leads to high power-to-weight ratio dynamic locomotion. In addition, the folding robot designs can span mass from 0.1 to 100 grams, although requiring ``toughening'' for the heavier robots. By integrating additional layers for sensing and actuation, future folded milli-robots could be made at very high volume and very low-cost.
